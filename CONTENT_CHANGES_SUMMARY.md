# Content Changes Summary

## Executive Summary

This reframing transforms Sapiens IT from a generic business consultancy into an elite engineering collective. The new messaging positions knowledge sharing as the primary mission, with consulting as a natural outcome of demonstrated expertise.

## Key Changes by Section

### 1. Hero Section
**Before:** "Transforme sua empresa com consultoria especializada" (Transform your company with specialized consulting)  
**After:** "Engineering, architecture, and systems that scale"

**Why:** Removes sales language. Focuses on what you actually do (engineering) rather than what you sell (consulting).

---

### 2. Services Section → "What We Do"
**Before:** Generic business services (Strategic Consulting, Digital Transformation, HR, Marketing)  
**After:** Three focused items: Knowledge Sharing, Architecture Guidance, Technical Consulting

**Why:** Removes services that don't match your expertise. Positions knowledge sharing first, consulting second.

---

### 3. Trainings Section
**Before:** Corporate training offerings  
**After:** Remove entirely (or replace with minimal "Our Approach" section)

**Why:** Training is not your core offering. Knowledge sharing through articles is.

---

### 4. Footer
**Before:** Corporate boilerplate with social links, contact info, quick links, legal pages  
**After:** "© 2025 Sapiens IT. Engineering without buzzwords."

**Why:** Minimal, technical tone. Removes corporate clutter that doesn't match the engineering collective identity.

---

### 5. About Page
**Before:** Generic company description  
**After:** Explains the collective, anonymous approach, and the "knowledge first, consulting second" model

**Why:** Clarifies positioning and explains why anonymity is an asset, not a weakness.

---

### 6. Manifesto
**Before:** Good start, but could be stronger  
**After:** More assertive, principle-driven, with clear statements like "We're not here to sell"

**Why:** Makes values explicit. Shows confidence and independence.

---

### 7. Blog Signature
**Before:** "Escrito pela equipe Sapiens IT — engenheiros que constroem antes de escrever"  
**After:** Standardize to "Written by engineers who build before they write. Sapiens IT Team"

**Why:** Consistent, memorable signature across all posts.

---

### 8. Contact Page
**Before:** Generic business contact with hours, address, phone  
**After:** Minimal, email-focused, explains preference for email communication

**Why:** Matches the technical, minimalist tone. Engineers prefer asynchronous communication.

---

## Brand Voice Transformation

### From Corporate to Engineering Collective

| **Before** | **After** |
|------------|-----------|
| "Transform your company" | "Engineering that scales" |
| "We offer solutions" | "We share knowledge" |

## Messaging Hierarchy

1. **Primary:** We are elite engineers sharing knowledge
2. **Secondary:** Our experience comes from production systems
3. **Tertiary:** Consulting is available for organizations that value engineering excellence

**Old hierarchy:**
1. We offer consulting services
2. We have expertise
3. Here's our blog

---

## Visual Tone Alignment

The content now matches a minimalist, technical aesthetic:

- **No gradients** (technical diagrams, not marketing visuals)
- **Sharp edges** (not rounded corners)
- **Monochrome or near-monochrome** (blue only for links if needed)
- **Abstract/technical imagery** (architecture diagrams, not people photos)
- **Generous whitespace** (readability over density)

## Credibility Building Strategy

### How the New Content Builds Authority

1. **Demonstrates expertise first:** Technical articles show competence before any sales pitch
2. **Shows independence:** Anonymous positioning suggests objectivity
3. **Focuses on what matters:** Architecture, scalability, performance — not generic business advice
4. **Speaks to the right audience:** Engineers talking to engineers
5. **Creates natural pipeline:** Companies seeking engineering excellence will reach out after reading content

### Why This Attracts Consulting Opportunities

- **Self-selection:** Only companies that value engineering excellence will engage
- **Higher quality leads:** Clients come pre-qualified by reading your technical content
- **Better positioning:** You're consulted as experts, not sold as vendors
- **Sustainable reputation:** Knowledge sharing creates lasting value and authority
