# Sapiens IT — Brand Voice & Content Guide

## Brand Voice Statement

Sapiens IT speaks as a collective of senior engineers who have built and maintained production systems at scale. We avoid corporate buzzwords, sales language, and generic business speak. Our voice is confident, direct, and pragmatic — the voice of engineers talking to engineers. We prefer precision over hype, experience over theory, and impact over visibility. We remain anonymous not for secrecy, but for independence: our ideas speak louder than our names.

```
We believe software engineering is a discipline, not improvisation.

## About Page Rewrite

**Title:**
```
About Sapiens IT
```

**Content:**

```
Sapiens IT is a collective of senior software engineers who share technical knowledge about architecture, performance, and scalability.

We write from experience. Every article, every architecture pattern we discuss, comes from real problems we've solved in production. Our backgrounds span industries — automotive, finance, manufacturing — but our focus is consistent: building systems that scale because they're well-designed, not because they're trendy.

We believe engineering excellence comes from clarity, discipline, and a focus on what actually works. We don't follow trends without question. We validate every technical decision against real-world results and long-term sustainability.

**Why we remain anonymous**

We prefer discretion over exposure — so our ideas speak louder than our names. This independence allows us to be candid about what works and what doesn't, without corporate filters or personal branding agendas.

**Our goal**

First, we build credibility through knowledge sharing. Technical articles that demonstrate deep understanding of complex systems. Then, naturally, we attract organizations that value engineering excellence and seek focused consulting.

We're not here to sell. We're here to raise the bar for software engineering.
```

## Manifesto Page Rewrite (Strengthen)

**Title:**
```
Our Manifesto
```

**Content:**

```
We believe software engineering is a discipline, not improvisation.

We write from experience, not theory.

Our goal is to raise the bar for engineering quality.
```

**Core Principles:**

```
**Precision over hype**

We prefer solutions that work over trends that fade. We validate every technical choice against production reality, not marketing materials.

**Simplicity over abstraction**

Systems that are understood are systems that are maintained. We favor clear designs over clever abstractions that only make sense to their creators.

**Scalability through design, not technology names**

Performance and scale come from architecture, not from which framework or service you use. We focus on principles, not product names.

**Discipline over convenience**

Shortcuts create technical debt. We advocate for doing things right, even when it takes more time upfront — because production systems require long-term thinking.

**Independence over influence**

We remain anonymous to preserve objectivity. Our recommendations aren't influenced by vendor relationships, personal brands, or corporate agendas. We say what we think, based on what we've seen work.

**Knowledge first, consulting second**

We share openly because knowledge should be accessible. When companies need deeper guidance, we provide focused consulting — but our primary mission is raising the engineering standard through education.
```

**Closing:**

```
We're not here to sell.

We're here to elevate software engineering as a discipline.

If that resonates with you, welcome.

## Visual Tone Guidance

### Layout Intent

1. **Minimalist structure**
   - Remove gradient backgrounds from hero
   - Use solid colors: dark grays, whites, minimal accent (if any)
   - Prefer monochrome or near-monochrome palette

2. **Typography hierarchy**
   - Large, clear headings (technical feel, not marketing)
   - Generous whitespace
   - Readable serif or sans-serif for body text
   - Code snippets clearly differentiated

3. **Grid and spacing**
   - Modular, consistent spacing
   - Clean grid for blog posts
   - No decorative elements

4. **Imagery**
   - Abstract, technical diagrams over stock photos
   - Architecture diagrams, system designs
   - Avoid: people photos, corporate imagery, generic business graphics

5. **Color palette suggestion**
   - Primary: Dark gray (#1a1a1a) or pure black
   - Secondary: Medium gray (#4a4a4a)
   - Background: White or very light gray (dark mode: dark gray)
   - Accent (minimal): Blue (#2563eb) only for links/CTAs if needed, otherwise monochrome

6. **Component tone**
   - Remove rounded corners from cards (use sharp edges)
   - Minimal shadows, if any
   - Remove hover effects that feel "playful"
   - Buttons: understated, not "CTA-heavy"

---

## Navigation Adjustments

**Header navigation:**
- Home
- Blog
- About
- Manifesto
- Contact

Remove or de-emphasize:
- Services (or replace with "What We Do" on homepage)
- Trainings

---

## Translation Notes

All content should maintain the same tone in English, Spanish, and Portuguese:

- **Portuguese (PT)**: Formal, direct, technical
- **English (EN)**: Professional, confident, pragmatic
- **Spanish (ES)**: Formal, clear, technical

Avoid regional colloquialisms. Keep language consistent across all three.

---

## Content Strategy Summary

### What This Achieves

1. **Credibility through expertise**: Technical focus and production experience build trust with engineering audiences.

2. **Differentiation**: Anonymous, knowledge-first positioning stands apart from typical consultancies with vendor relationships and personal branding.

3. **Authority building**: Deep technical articles demonstrate competence before any sales conversation begins.

4. **Natural consulting pipeline**: Companies that value engineering excellence will seek you out after reading your content. No aggressive sales needed.

5. **Long-term reputation**: Knowledge sharing creates lasting value and establishes Sapiens IT as a thought leader in architecture and scalability.

### Why This Works

- **Engineers trust other engineers**: Technical content from production experience builds credibility faster than marketing copy.

- **Quality over quantity**: Fewer, deeper articles are more valuable than frequent shallow posts.

- **Independence as asset**: Anonymity and vendor-neutral stance make recommendations more trustworthy.

- **Consulting as outcome, not goal**: When consulting comes from demonstrated expertise rather than sales, it's more valuable and sustainable.
